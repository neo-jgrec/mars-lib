## Mars Library

### What is Mars-lib ?

**OBI-WAN** : It's over, Anakin. I have the high ground.

**ANAKIN** : You underestimate my power!

**OBI-WAN** : Don't try it.

**ANAKIN** : struggles to pull himself up the embankment with his mechanical hand. His thin leather glove has been burned off. He keeps sliding down in the black sand.

**OBI-WAN** : (continuing) . . . You were the Chosen One! It was said that you would, destroy the Sith, not join them. It was you who would bring balance to the Force, not leave it in Darkness.

**OBI-WAN** : picks up Anakin's light saber and begins to walk away. He stops and looks back.

**ANAKIN** : I hate you!

**OBI-WAN** : You were my brother, Anakin. I loved you.

### Now that you know what it is, let's see what it does

Mars-lib is a library that contains a set of tools to help you in your development. It is composed of 3 main parts :
- **my_stdlib** : a set of functions that are a reproduction of the C standard library and some more, I invite you to check the documentation for more information.
- **my_printf** : a function that allows you to print formatted strings.
- **mini_linked_list** : a set of functions that allows you to create and manipulate linked lists using tailq. The lib lacks a lot of functions, but I will add them in the future.
